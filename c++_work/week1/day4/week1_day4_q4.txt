	int y = x+++2  this expression works as int y = (x++) + 2;

	so question is why we get y = 6

	precedence of ++ is more then + but still since this postfix the value of x will be updated after the excution this whole line

	if we do (int y = ++x +2;) then we get y = 7 so in this case the value x is updated before anything executes in this line
