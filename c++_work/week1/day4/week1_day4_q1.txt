assert(3 == 3.0); // this line runs fine this will pass 
float x = 3.1;		
assert(x == 3.1);	//this line fails on run time. if we change type of x to double then it will work or we type cast (float)3.1 then it works fine explained futhure below
assert(3.1 == 3.1);	
assert(true == 1.0);
assert('a' == 97);
int* p = 0;
assert(NULL == p);
assert(NULL == 0);



 
since we know that in float we have 23 bits for fractional portion and 52 bits in double

when we compare float with double after 23rd bit compiler pad the float value with 0s 

so if we computer decimal value for both x and 3.0 it will be different and we get False from ==
